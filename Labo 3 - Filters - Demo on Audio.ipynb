    "We consider an application from the real world: audio signal filtering. The audio signal of choice is the song <a href="https://2022.aulaweb.unige.it/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UVNT4wvIGY\%22">Somebody that I used to know</a> by Gotye feat. Kymbra, 2011. This song presents low frequency components (the bassline is played the same way during the whole song), as well as high frequency ones (a xylophone maybe?) as well as components that show up in basically every band (Gotye's and Kymbra's voices). Let's listen to this song."
